# GRAFT

A gRPC based plugin to add distributed consensus system to your applications. Let's say you have a replicated web-server, and you need to shared some consensus value between them. In that case, GRAFT helps by providing HTTP APIs to share your values using RAFT protocol.

Instead of using message-brokers and unrelaiable heavy systems, GRAFT is a light super fast consensus sharing system to exchange states between your applications.
